Vice versa, external RF signals may be picked up by the MRI system which will adversely impact the accuracy of the imaging data. Thus MRI rooms have to be effectively shielded from both incoming and outgoing RF interference. To provide RF shielding, a Faraday’s cage have to be build to cover the MRI scan machine with varied metals like Copper, Galvanized Iron and Aluminium depending on numerous specifications and customer requirements. The shield should have good attenuation of more than 90DB to perform which will isolate the MRI scan machine from rest of structures of building, electronics equipment’s etc.</p>",
