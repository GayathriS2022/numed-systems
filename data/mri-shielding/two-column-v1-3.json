Doors, windows and penetrations for supply services are also shielded or fitted with filters to prevent RF leakage.</li><li>RF enclosures are delivered to site in prefabricated modules or assembled by NuMed trained technician thus consuming lesser turn around time.</li><li>With the exception of the floor, the RF cage can be dis-mantled and erected at another location if necessary.</li>/ul>",
