For Example, MRI should be planned away from moving ferromagnet objects and HT powerlines Similarly a CT Should be planned as per AERB regulations. Our trained engineers will support customers to select suitable location in their facility for equipment installation which comply with OEM installation requirement. While selecting the location we consider the facts like equipment transportation, suitable height for each equipment, building strength, Room height etc. Which will Help trouble free upgradation of equipment in the future.</p>",
