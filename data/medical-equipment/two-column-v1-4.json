Because planning at dismantling location and receiving location has to be synchronised, for example a cold magnet connected with cryogen circuit to be disconnected only just hours before the loading, once it is loaded into the truck it has to reach destination without loosing a single minute, and unloading, movement positioning and connecting back to life support to be done like a war foot situation. Our experienced project Managers will ensure with various stake owners for a trouble-free relocation of equipment.</p>",
